				<h4 class="curriculum">Investment Fund</h4>
				<span>
                Thanks to the generous gifts of donors, PNG invests out of a national flagship investment fund into real publicly traded equities. 
                All active members of PNG, both research analysts and quantitative developers, develop research reports and relevant software 
                that contributes directly to the strategies utilized in the fund.

                    The goal of the investment fund is to provide students with real-world application to the topics taught in the 
                    educational portion. Students can apply both fundamental analysis and systematic algorithms to identify
                    potential asset upside and optimize returns.

						<h3>Part 1: Systematic Factor Construction Algorithm</h3>
						<p>PNG uses factor analysis to isolate a smaller universe of assets that fit within a quantitative bound with 
                            identified price upside. The model runs a multivariate regression of every public company with a market cap 
                            above $1bn onto the value and momentum factors. Parameters are applied to the results of the regression
                            to isolate assets that fall within the bounds. 
                             The Quantitative Development team at national and chapter levels will work to further develop models to continuously improve the 
                             asset selection as well as developing other data visualization software to help with investment process.

						<h3>Part 2: Fundamental Analysis</h3>
						<p>Once the assets are reduced based off the factor model, portfolio managers can select a 
                            few assets from the list for each analyst to conduct primary research on. The portfolio manager will then
                             choose one of these companies, after reading the primary research, for their analyst group to work
                             together to do an in-depth value-based investment analysis on.
                             This involves a qualitative understanding of the company and a quantitative analysis of value 
                             using intrinsic and relative valuation techniques.</p>

							<h3>Part 3: Portfolio Allocation</h3>
							<p>PNG utilizes a novel adjustment of the mean-variance portfolio allocation formula. 
                                The novel adjustment diagonalizes the covariance matrix so only the covariances between the asset and itself remain 
                                (simply the variances of the assets in the matrix). This makes the resulting mean-variance portfolio less sensitive 
                                to the in-sample volatility of the assets, has a long-only asset weighting structure, and results in a better out-of-sample 
                                Sharpe.
                            Students on the quantitative development committees can work to optimize or construct new allocation measures for the fund.</p>
