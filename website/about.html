							<h3>Quantitative Finance</h3>
							<p>Part 3 of the curriculum focuses on educating students on applied forms of Quantitative Portfolio Management, utilizing the information learned in the first 2 parts of the curriculum. 
								Students will learn the basics of modern portfolio theory including analysis of systematic and idiosyncratic risks and total return analysis using the 
								Sharpe, Info, and Treynor ratios. Eventually students will learn to construct a portfolio based off the Mean-Variance Analysis. Basic statistics, linear algebra, 
								and applied regression analysis will be taught in conjunction with this portion. Later, factor regression analysis will be taught with a focus on systematic
								portfolio construction and smart beta.</p>
