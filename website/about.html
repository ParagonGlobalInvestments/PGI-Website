				<h4>Who we are</h4>
				<span>The Paragon National Group is an organization dedicated to the development of students in both value 
				investing fundamentals and in an understanding of technology, computer programming, and data science. 
				We believe that an understanding of computer and data science is pivotal in the current 
				business environment as technology is becoming integrated into every sector and the demand of analysts 
				who can code is constantly increasing. </span>

						<h3>Finance and Investing</h3>
						<p>Part 1 of the curriculum will help students gain a basic understanding behind the theory and strategies of value investing. Students will gain a fundamental understanding of accounting, 
							general competitive analysis, and valuation. General modeling (including discounted cash flow models, leveraged buyout models, and mergers and acquisition models) will be explored as well as 
							general investment theory related to these models. By the end of the curriculum, students will be able to accurately value companies from scratch, compare possible investments using theory, and will 
							be tested through a comprehensive stock pitch. More advanced topics such as leveraged finance, credit investments, and restructuring will be explored as time-permits. </p>

						<h3>Computer and Data Science</h3>
						<p>Part 2 of the curriculum aims to educate students on the theory and applications of computer and data science.
							The curriculum will revolve around the Python programming language. Students will learn underlying theory of computer systems, basic programming in python, 
							and applied data science using Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib. Topics will focus on teaching the students syntax and uses of basic python and will also explore 
							more advanced concepts like Object Orientated Programming, Input and Output, Web Scraping, and more. The Data Science curriculum will teach students how to analyze 
							and manipulate data to derive complex statistical analyses from data tables. Using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, etc., our students will be able to collect, clean, and analyze 
							raw data to create meaningful reports and draw quality conclusions by implementing the basics of Python and R.</p>

						<h3>Quantitative Portfolio Management</h3>
						<p>Part 3 of the curriculum focuses on educating students on applied forms of Quantitative Portfolio Management using the information learned in the first 2 parts of the curriculum. 
							Students will learn the basic of modern portfolio theory including analysis of systematic and idiosyncratic risks  and total return analysis using the 
							Sharpe, Info, and Treynor ratios. Eventually students will learn to construct a portfolio based off the Mean-Variance Analysis and its variations. Basic statistics, linear algebra, 
							and applied regression analysis will be taught in conjunction with this portion. Later, factor analysis and investing will be taught with a focus on smart beta, hedging, and tracking assets. 
							This conclusion to the course will teach students not only to pick the best assets, but to also analyze their portfolio allocation to optimize their portfolio returns.</p>
