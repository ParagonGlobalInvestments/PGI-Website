          Thanks to the generous gifts of donors and sponsors, PNG invests
          $40,000 into both the PNG Value Fund and PNG Systematic Fund.
          Members of PNG both develop pitches on mispriced assets and
          research and develop novel algorithmic trading strategies that will
          be invested out of their respective funds.

          PNG's investment funds provide students with
          real-world opportunities to apply what they are taught in PNG's education. 
          Students can apply both fundamental analysis and systematic
          algorithms to identify potential asset upside and optimize returns.
